John, a busy dad of two, wanted to get fit but couldn’t find time for the gym. Frustrated, he decided to try a micro-habit: one push-up
every morning before his coffee. It felt ridiculously easy, but that was the point. After a week, he added a second push-up.Six months later,
John was doing 20-minute bodyweight workouts daily and felt stronger than ever. That one push-up sparked a fitness habit that changed his 
energy and confidence.

<span id="i3"><u>Productivity:</u></span> <b>Sarah’s One-Sentence Novel</b>
Sarah, an aspiring writer, dreamed of finishing a novel but struggled to find time. She committed to writing just one sentence a day
after breakfast. Some days, that sentence led to a paragraph; other days, it was just the one. By the end of a year, she had a rough draft 
of 20,000 words.“It wasn’t about writing a book,” Sarah says. “It was about showing up every day.” Her micro-habit turned a 
daunting dream into reality.

<span id="i5">Mental Health:</span> <b>Maria’s Minute of Calm</b>
Maria, a stressed-out teacher, wanted to manage her anxiety. She started with one minute of deep breathing each evening. That tiny pause became
her anchor, helping her feel calmer and more present. Over time, she extended it to five minutes of mindfulness, which she credits 
with improving her sleep and focus. “One minute didn’t feel like much,” Maria says, “but it gave me permission to prioritize myself.”
