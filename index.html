        <h1> The power of micro-habits:<br>small habits that transform your life</h1> 
        <p id="i3">Have you ever set big, shiny goal-like runningn a marathon, writing a book, or getting organized- only to crash and burn a week later?
            you're not alone. Big goals can feel like mountains, and the climb often seems too steep. but what if i told you that you could transform
            your life with changes so small they almost feel effortless? </p>

            <p id="i2">Enter micro-habits: tiny, intentional actions that take less than a minute or two but compound over time to create massive results.<br>
                 Imagine writing just one sentence a day. In a year, you'd have 365 sentences-enough for short story or the start of a novel.<br> Or 
                doing one push-up daily. It sounds silly, but it could spark a fitness routine.</p>
